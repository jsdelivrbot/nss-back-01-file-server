# HTTP Server

- [ ] Create a valid html file called `index.html`. It should contain:
    - [ ] An `<h1>` saying: "My First Node.js Web Server" 
    - [ ] An image linking to the Node.js logo: ![](https://rawgit.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/886b30fde80f35fd0db98793f258d78a9ae0a997/static/images/logo-light.svg)
- [ ] Create a Node.js server in a file called `server01.js`. Use the createServer method along with `createReadStream()` to pipe the html file to the browser.
